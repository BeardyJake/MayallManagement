    <h1>What can we do for you?</h1>
    <h4>TAKING VISION TO ACTION</h4>
    <p>We offer help with quality, audit, strategic and business planning, workforce development, restructuring, networking and commissioning support. Without wanting to sound big headed (well maybe a little) we are good at what we do and pretty passionate about it to boot. Passionate also about equality, kindness and humanity.
    <br>
    <br>      
    Writing type stuff can include recruitment and HR documents including adverts and JDs/PSs and contracts (with serious consultation), copywriting, proofreading, bids and tenders, PR, expert policy refinement development and adjustment, governance, almost any wordy type stuff that you want. Poetry and short stories sometimes happen but usually under a different name...</p>

    <h1>What People Say About Us</h1>
    <h4>The Proof is in the Eating of the Pudding. Or Something...</h4>
    <p class="quote">"</p>
    <p><strong>Sue Clifford FInstLM</strong><br>
      <strong>Chief Executive at No Offence! CIC</strong><br>
      Bernie recognises what is important to make a difference and quietly goes about making that happen. She is extraordinarily knowledgeable and insightful and her expertise and dedication make sure that she achieves her goal, for which we are very grateful. Bernie is a wonderful person and an important member of our Advisory Board.</p>

    <p><strong>Robert McCrea BA Hons MIOD</strong><br>
      <strong>Change Management Consultant and Interim CEO</strong><br>
      I have really enjoyed working with Bernie. Her diplomatic skill, ability to get to the root of the issues and work with us to come up with creative solutions is excellent. A very cool head at dealing with complex issues and a strong ability to support others in their development has made Bernie a tremendous asset to our partnership work.</p>

    <p><strong>Bill Puddicombe</strong><br>
      <strong>Consultant and Interim Executive</strong><br>
      It isn't often that one gets to work with someone who actually carries out the tasks they say they are going to carry out, when promised. Consequently it was a joy to work with Bernie - who not only delivers but does so with exceptional good humour and a great way with people...not to mention a supply of good coffee.
      <br>
      <br>      
      I would recommend Bernie to manage and complete complex projects in difficult environments.</p>
