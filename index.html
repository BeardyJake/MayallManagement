    <h1>What can we do for you?</h1>
    <h4>TAKING VISION TO ACTION</h4>
    <p>We offer help with quality, audit, strategic and business planning, workforce development, restructuring, networking and commissioning support. Without wanting to sound big headed (well maybe a little) we are good at what we do and pretty passionate about it to boot. Passionate also about equality, kindness and humanity.
    <br>
    <br>      
    Writing type stuff can include recruitment and HR documents including adverts and JDs/PSs and contracts (with serious consultation), copywriting, proofreading, bids and tenders, PR, expert policy refinement development and adjustment, governance, almost any wordy type stuff that you want. Poetry and short stories sometimes happen but usually under a different name...</p>
